    "\n",
    "For running the matching with SuperGlue, a new SuperGlueMatcher object must be initialized with the parameters for SuperGlue matching (see the documentation of the class for more details). The parameters are given as a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The configuration dictionary may contain the following keys:\n",
    "- \"weights\": defines the type of the weights used for SuperGlue inference. It can be either \"indoor\" or \"outdoor\". The default value is \"outdoor\".\n",
    "- \"keypoint_threshold\": threshold for the SuperPoint keypoint detector. The default value is 0.001.\n",
    "- \"max_keypoints\": maximum number of keypoints to be detected by SuperPoint. If -1, no limit to keypoint detection is set. The default value is -1.\n",
    "- \"match_threshold\": threshold for the SuperGlue feature matcher. Default value is 0.3.\n",
    "- \"force_cpu\": if True, SuperGlue will run on CPU. Default value is False.\n",
    "- \"nms_radius\": radius for non-maximum suppression. Default value is 3.\n",
    "- \"sinkhorn_iterations\": number of iterations for the Sinkhorn algorithm. Default value is 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the configuration dictionary is not given, the default values are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "When running the matching, additional parameters can be given as arguments to the `match` method to define the matching behavior. The parameters are the following:\n",
    "- image0: the first image to be matched.\n",
    "- image1: the second image to be matched.\n",
    "- quality: define the resize factor for the input images. Possible values \"highest\", \"high\" or \"medium\", \"low\". With \"high\", images are matched with full resulution. With \"highest\" images are up-sampled by a factor 2. With \"medium\" and \"low\" images are downsampled respectively by a factor 2 and 4. The default value is \"high\".\n",
    "- tile_selection: tile selection approach. Possible values are `TileSelection.None`, `TileSelection.EXHAUSTIVE`, `TileSelection.GRID` or `TileSelection.PRESELECTION`. Refer to the following \"Tile Section\" section for more information. The default value is `TileSelection.PRESELCTION`.\n",
    "- grid: if tile_selection is not `TileSelection.None`, this parameter defines the grid size.\n",
    "- overlap: if tile_selection is not `TileSelection.None`, this parameter defines the overlap between tiles.\n",
    "- do_viz_matches: if True, the matches are visualized. Default value is False.\n",
    "- do_viz_tiles: if True, the tiles are visualized. Default value is False.\n",
    "- save_dir: if not None, the matches are saved in the given directory. Default value is None.\n",
    "- geometric_verification: defines the geometric verification approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tile Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "To guarantee the highest collimation accuracy, by default the matching is performed on full resolution images.\n",
    "However, due to limited memory capacity in mid-class GPUs, high- resolution images captured by DSLR cameras may not fit into GPU memory. To overcome this limitation, ICEPy4D divides the images into smaller regular tiles with maximum dimension of 2000 px, computed over a regular grid.\n",
    "The tile selection can be performed in four different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `TileSelection.None`  \n",
    "   Images are matched as a whole in just one step. No tiling is performed.\n",
    "2. `TileSelection.EXHAUSTIVE`  \n",
    "   All the tiles in the first image are matched with all the tiles in the second image. This approach is very computational demading as the pairs of tiles are all the possible combinations of tiles from the two images and the total number of pairs rises quickly with the number of tiles. Additionally, several spurios matches may be found in tiles that do not overlap in the two images. \n",
    "3. `TileSelection.GRID`  \n",
    "   Tiles pairs are selected only based on the position of each tile in the grid, i.e., tile 1 in imageA is matched with tile 1 in imageB, tile 2 in imageA is matched with tile 2 in imageB, and so on. This approach is less computational demanding than the exhaustive one, but it is suitable only for images that are well aligned along a stripe with regular viewing geometry.\n",
    "4. `TileSelection.PRESELECTION`  \n",
    "   This is the only actual 'preselection' of the tiles, as the process is carried out in two steps.\n",
    "   First, a matching is performed on downsampled images. Subsequently, the full-resolution images are subdivided into regulartiles, and only the tiles that have corresponding features in the low-resolution images are selected as candidates for a second matching step.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a tile pre-selection approach is chosen, the tile grid must be defined by the `tile_grid` argument. This is a list of integers that defines the number of tiles along the x and y direction (i.e., number of columns and number of rows). For example, `tile_grid=[3,2]` defines a grid with 3 columns and 2 rows.\n",
    "Additionally, a parameter specifiyng the overlap between different tiles can be defined by the `overlap` argument. This is an integer number that defines the number of pixels of overlap between adjacent tiles. For example, `overlap=200` defines an overlap of 100 pixels between adjacent tiles. The overlap helps to avoid missing matches at the tile boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following figure shows the tile preselection process. An example of the tiles that are selected for the second matching step are highlighted in green.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](figs/tile_preselection.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Geometric Verification\n",
    "Geometric verification of the matches is performed by using Pydegensac (Mishkin et al., 2015), that allows for robustly estimate the fundamental matrix. \n",
    "The maximum re-projection error to accept a match is set to 1.5 px by default, but it can be changed by the user. \n",
    "The successfully matched features, together with their descriptors and scores, are saved as a Features object for each camera and stored into the current Epoch object."
