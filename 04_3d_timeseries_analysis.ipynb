    "\n",
    "Essentially, 4D point clouds are time series of topographic data with a dense temporal dimension, beyond a \"handful\" of multitemporal acquisitions. This means, the time domain represents the behavior of the surface and process characteristics, opposed to multitemporal 3D point clouds which contain mostly pre- and post-states of changes with fewer (typically less than 100) epochs.\n",
    "There is no fixed definition about the temporal density or length of 3D time series. Capturing surface processes near-continuously rather depends on the relation of acquisition frequency to the change rates of observed phenomena in a scene. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [main strategies of near-continuous 3D acquisition](../01_pointcloud_principles/01_pointcloud_principles.md#point-cloud-acquisition) are permanent terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and time-lapse photogrammetry. A fixed installation of sensors enables to repeat the acquisition at very high frequency, even seconds to minutes (<a href=\"#references\">Eitel et al., 2016</a>). The temporal interval depends on the requirements of the application, and is therefore typically defined by an analyst, but also limited by the sensor capabilities. As the sensors are programmed for automatic acquisition, they can be left alone for continued observation and generate time series of several weeks, months, and years.\n"

To observe different processes, like erosion during storms, formation and movement of sand bars, aeolian sand transport and effects of human interventions, topographic data at high spatial and temporal resolution is required. For this, a TLS was installed in a fixed position at three locations at the Dutch and Belgian coast. One of these locations is the beach at Kijkduin, The Netherlands, where hourly point clouds were acquired for six months, resulting in over 4,000 consecutive scans of the beach scene (<a href=\"#references\">Vos et al., 2022</a>).

If the acquisition frequency were lower, multiple rockfall events may occur in the same area of the rock cliff in the meantime (<a href=\"#references\">Williams et al., 2018</a>). Such coinciding events cannot be identified individually, if no acquisitions in-between the events are available. Using 4D point clouds, i.e. near-continuous observation, we can resolve single events and thereby also describe the spatiotemporal rockfall characteristics. For example, it can be observed how rockfall events coalesce and result in larger rockfall areas on a cliff. <a href=\"#references\">Williams et al. (2019)</a> have used 4D point clouds acquired by hourly TLS at a coastal cliff to investigate the magnitude-frequency distribution of rockfall events. Only from the high-frequency data, it was possible to identify a large number of small - but more frequent - rockfalls. In sum, these small events make a large contribution to overall mass loss at the cliff and are therefore important to capture for gaining insight on underlying processes and drivers."

[contents of Theme 3](../03_3d_change_analysis/03_3d_change_analysis.ipynb#uncertainty-in-change-analysis)). Of course these influences are also present in case of near-continuous point cloud acquisitions.

    "In this PLS setting, elevation differences are in a range of 5 cm, with peaks at 10 cm. A direct link to atmospheric conditions can be established when comparing to air temperature records from a regional meteorological station. It needs to be noted, that this strong influence is not necessarily caused only by the influence of atmospheric conditions on the refraction of the LiDAR beam (cf. <a href=\"#references\">Friedli et al, 2019</a>). Another aspect we need to consider is the stability of the 'fixed' instrument itself. Depending on the installation, there may be material deformations linked to changing temperatures, which influence the orientation of the sensor and would have similar effects on the range measurement (<a href=\"#references\">Anders al., 2019</a>). By now, detailed experiments and investigations have been conducted with high-frequency, permanent TLS to further understand environmental influences and the stability of laser scanning time series (e.g., <a href=\"#references\">Kuschnerus et al., 2021; Voordendag et al., 2023</a>). Thereby, a lot has also been learnt to improve their setup and efforts are being made to reduce external influences to the level known by standard, multitemporal surveys. Systematic effects that remain, e.g. misalignments, can be reduced through standard approaches, such as [rigid transformation](../01_pointcloud_principles/01_pointcloud_principles.md#transformation-of-3d-point-cloud-data) using fixed reference objects or surfaces (cf.

    "The 4D filtering method by <a href=\"#references\">Kromer et al. (2015)</a> performs averaging in space and time simultaneously. In other studies, these steps have sometimes been separated into first spatial and secondly temporal averaging or filtering. For example, spatial smoothing may already be introduced by deriving digital elevation models (DEMs), in the process of rasterizing point clouds. Thereafter, averaging of change values in [DEMs of difference](../03_3d_change_analysis/03_3d_change_analysis.ipynb#surface-change-analysis) along the 1D time series in each raster cell yields temporal smoothing to achieve further reduction of noise. This approach is used by <a href=\"#references\">Eltner et al., 2017</a> for the analysis of soil surface changes acquired by time-lapse photogrammetry. The concept of additional temporal smoothing can also be applied to 3D time series of surface changes (rather than solely rasterized topographic changes). For example, time series of M3C2 distances <a href=\"#references\">Lague et al., 2013</a> at core point locations [cf. introduction of the method in previous theme](../03_3d_change_analysis/03_3d_change_analysis.ipynb#surface-change-analysis) can be used to apply, e.g., median filtering to derived 3D changes (e.g., <a href=\"#references\">Anders et al., 2021</a>). With the M3C2, spatial smoothing has already been introduced in the step of point cloud distance computation, where points are averaged in the 3D neighborhood around each core point. Beyond this, advanced time series filtering methods have been proposed to further reduce uncertainties through full incorporation of the temporal domain (e.g., <a href=\"#references\">Winiwarter et al., 2022</a>).

This is ideal for near-continuous topographic observation, as we generally cannot know a priori about all possible types of surface activities occurring in the observed scene. \n",

The objective is to separate the observed scene into distinct spatial regions where each region (cluster) represents a time series associated to a specific change pattern. This change pattern, ultimately, can be linked to characteristic surface processes shaping this region. The following figure visualizes how two time series in a scene can be similar according to their Euclidian distance (the lower, the more similar) or according to their correlation (between 0 and 1, with 1 being fully correlated):\n",

The clustering further separates the upper and lower part of the slope, and the flat area at the bottom of the slope.

These spatial clusters could now be used to further assess process characterstics in the scene. \n",

For our dataset, these are present in large part of the scene in point clouds acquired during the night, as the TLS was moved to a protected, more occluded, position (cf. <a href=\"#references\">Anders et al., 2022</a>). These gaps over multiple hours are not interpolated by our temporal averaging with a smaller window. Removing NoData values from single time series is no solution here, as the metrics can neither be derived for time series of unequal length (<a href=\"#references\">Kuschnerus et al., 2021</a>). This aspect therefore needs to be accounted for during data preparation, for example, by introducing stronger spatial and/or temporal interpolation where possible. An alternative could also be to adapt the analysis approach, for example, assessing change patterns for temporal subsets of the time series or at lower temporal sampling, e.g., by selecting only one measurement per day, week, and so on.\n"

    "Next, we parametrize the 4D-OBC extraction by specifying a spatial neighborhood radius for searching locations during region growing, a minimum number of segments for an object to be valid (i.e. not discarded), and a minimum period and height threshold for seed timespans to be considered for region growing. The `thresholds` parameter defines the set of thresholds to be used for determining time series similarity (cf. <a href=\"#references\">Anders et al., 2021</a>). In general, the lower the values that are included (starting from 0.1), the stricter the spatial delineation in the segmentation. The seed candidates can be specified to limit the object extraction to specific core point locations (optional), otherwise all locations will be searched for potential seeds and the object extraction conducted for the full dataset (long and computationally intensive processing). Here, we apply the object extraction to our one selected core point location in the avalanche deposition."

    "As aimed, our extracted 4D-OBC covers the timespan of the avalanche-related increase. The time series and changes in the scene are colored by the magnitude of each segmented location in the selected timespan - derived as the difference of change values at the end epoch and the start epoch of the individual object. By this, even though we use a time series of surface change to a fixed reference (first epoch), we are independent from fixed intervals and purely bitemporal change quantification. For each extracted object, we are considering exactly the time series information of their occurrence, which can be highly variable (and even overlapping) within a scene. The map shows how the time series-based segmentation approach nicely delineates the avalanche deposition area. Apparently, what looks like two neighboring avalanches occurred during exactly the same timespan, and is therefore extracted as one space-time event. A spatial separation of the deposition areas may be achieved by parametrizing the similarity thresholds more strictly - try it out if you are working in the interactive notebook, to get a better feeling of the method's properties."
